        <h2>The Retreat House At Ngorongoro!</h2>
        <p class="text">
            The Monastery has a guest-quarter compounded by 20 self-contained rooms. The rooms are simple but
            comfortable, vary in size and may accommodate up to 5 people. The rooms are furnished with mosquito-netted
            double beds, twin beds, or a combination of both. Every room has an individual toilet and a shower with hot
            water. Included in your full-board accommodation, delicious and abundant meals are prepared and served by
            the nuns and novices in a wide common guest dining-hall.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            There are 3 daily meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and tea/coffee in-between meals. Most of the food is
            either sustainably and organically grown in our garden and fields or locally sourced from the markets and
            producers in the area
        </p>

        <h2>Activities In The Area</h2>
        <p class="text">
            While at the monastery, you can see the nuns and local staff working in the garden, the farm, the stalls,

            our barn, go on a mystic walk through the fields surrounding the monastery, visit and pray in the chapel
