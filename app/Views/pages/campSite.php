            Approaching from the southeast the road crosses open steppe, with the line of the great rift valley
            escarpment looming increasingly up ahead, the mountains of Ngorongoro beyond. As the road reaches the rift
            it enters the suddenly verdant and well watered areas around the small town of Karatu.

                        vehicles. We remember one occasion when we had to sit very still and hold our breathe whilst a
